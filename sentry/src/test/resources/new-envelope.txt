This is\nusually caused by the contents being too big for the RenderFlex.\nConsider applying a flex factor (e.g. using an Expanded widget)\nto force the children of the RenderFlex to fit within the\navailable space instead of being sized to their natural size.\nThis is considered an error condition because it indicates that\nthere is content that cannot be seen. If the content is\nlegitimately bigger than the available space, consider clipping\nit with a ClipRect widget before putting it in the flex, or using\na scrollable container rather than a Flex, like a ListView.\nThe specific RenderFlex in question is: RenderFlex#38899 OVERFLOWING:\n  parentData: <none> (can use size)\n  constraints: BoxConstraints(w=300.0, h=500.0)\n  size: Size(300.0, 500.0)\n  direction: horizontal\n  mainAxisAlignment: start\n  mainAxisSize: max\n  crossAxisAlignment: center\n  textDirection: ltr\n  verticalDirection: down\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n=================================================================\n"},"exception":{"values":[{"type":"FlutterError","value":"A RenderFlex overflowed by 1175 pixels on the right.","mechanism":{"type":"FlutterError","handled":true}}]},"level":"fatal","breadcrumbs":[{"timestamp":"2020-12-16T11:44:30.932Z","category":"navigation","data":{"state":"didPush","to":"/"},"level":"info","type":"navigation"},{"timestamp":"2020-12-16T11:44:37.822Z","category":"navigation","data":{"state":"didPush","from":"/","to":"ScaffoldWithUiError"},"level":"info","type":"navigation"}],"sdk":{"name":"sentry.dart.flutter","version":"4.0.0","packages":[{"name":"pub:sentry","version":"4.0.0"},{"name":"pub:sentry_flutter","version":"4.0.0"}],"integrations":["isolateErrorIntegration","flutterErrorIntegration","widgetsBindingIntegration","nativeSdkIntegration","loadAndroidImageListIntegration","loadReleaseIntegration","runZonedGuardedIntegration"]}}
